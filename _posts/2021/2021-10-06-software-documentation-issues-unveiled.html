    One of the smartest things a mid-sized tech company can do is hire a librarian.
    You probably don't need one if you're two dozen people who all know each other
    and have at least a vague idea of what one another are doing,
    but by the time you have a hundred staff,
    someone needs to be responsible for figuring out how the wiki and Google Docs should be organized,
    what tags every repo should have,
    and so on.
    Without that,
    entropy slowly takes over
    and you spend an ever-increasing amount of time trying to find the design docs
    that you're sure someone wrote last year
    except maybe they were under their personal account and we no longer have access.
  </p>
  <p>
    <cite>Aghajani2019</cite> doesn't tackle this problem directly.
    Instead,
    it does the essential pre-work of taxonomizing the problems people have with software documentation
    by scraping data from GitHub issues, pull requests, mailing lists, and Stack Overflow.
    The result is the sort of evidence-based categorization that librarians (and the authors of linting tools) swoon overâ€”you can
    click on the figure to get the full-sized version:

    </a>
  </div>
  <p>
    The full paper explains what each category and sub-category means,
    how common it is,
    and the evidence the authors have to justify its inclusion.
    As a bonus,
    they have made <a href="https://github.com/REVEAL-ICSE19-DocIssues/ReplicationPackage">a replication package on GitHub</a>
    if you'd like to explore their data yourself.
    It's the kind of quiet foundational contribution that our field needs more of,
    and I hope it will lead to tools that automatically warn developers about common problems.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  (Good) Software documentation provides developers and users with a
  description of what a software system does, how it operates, and how
  it should be used. For example, technical documentation (e.g., an
  API reference guide) aids developers during evolution/maintenance
  activities, while a user manual explains how users are to interact
  with a system. Despite its intrinsic value, the creation and the
  maintenance of documentation is often neglected, negatively
  impacting its quality and usefulness, ultimately leading to a
  generally unfavourable take on documentation. Previous studies
  investigating documentation issues have been based on surveying
  developers, which naturally leads to a somewhat biased view of
  problems affecting documentation. We present a large scale empirical
  study, where we mined, analyzed, and categorized 878
  documentation-related artifacts stemming from four different
  sources, namely mailing lists, Stack Overflow discussions, issue
  repositories, and pull requests. The result is a detailed taxonomy
  of documentation issues from which we infer a series of actionable
  proposals both for researchers and practitioners.
