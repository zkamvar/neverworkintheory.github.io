    Today was my eighth day in my new job,
    and I have already had to come to grips with the APIs of half a dozen packages and web services.
    Figuring out what's available to call and what it will do is central to modern programming,
    so any research that helps us do it more efficiently is very welcome.

  <p>
    <cite>Gao2020</cite> is a preliminary observatory study
    designed to help create a theoretical framework for that task.
    It draws on cognitive load theory,
    information foraging theory,
    and research into external memory
    (i.e., the ways in which jot things down, draw sketches, and otherwise use things outside our heads to help us remember).
    The activities they identify aren't surprising—people run searches,
    go down blind alleys,
    re-order tabs,
    and try things out to see if they're on the right track—but
    assembling it all to create a map like the one shown below
    is essential if we're to find better ways to discover and learn what's possible.

  Modern programming frequently requires the use of APIs (Application
  Programming Interfaces). Yet many programmers struggle when trying to learn
  APIs. We ran an exploratory study in which we observed participants performing
  an API learning task. We analyze their processes using a proposed model of API
  learning, grounded in Cognitive Load Theory, Information Foraging Theory, and
  External Memory research. The results provide support for the model of API
  Learning and add new insights into the form and usage of external memory while
  learning APIs. Programmers quickly curated a set of API resources through
  Information Foraging which served as external memory and then primarily
  referred to these resources to meet information needs while
  coding.
