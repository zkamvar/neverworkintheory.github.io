  <p>
    The slow but steady normalization of continuous integration (CI)
    has changed software development just as profoundly as reliance on Q&amp;A sites:
    by the time I have merged a pull request into the <code>main</code> branch
    of one of the project's I'm working on,
    a dozen different checks and actions have run automatically,
    at least half of which could reject the merge.
    I believe this automation has made developers more productive,
    but like any tool it can be used badly,
    so <cite>Zampetti2020</cite> used interviews and mined Stack Overflow posts to find out how.
    Their <a href="{{'/static/2021/Zampetti2020-catalog.pdf' | relative_url}}">complete catalog</a>
    divides 79 distinct smells into seven categories—repository issues,
    infrastructure choices,
    build process organization,
    build maintainability,
    quality assurance,
    delivery process,
    and culture—and the underlying data is
    <a href="http://home.ing.unisannio.it/fiorella.zampetti/datasets/CIBadPractices.zip">available online</a>.
    As with evidence-based taxonomies in other domains,
    I hope this work will be taken up by people building CI tools
    (and linters for those tools).

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Continuous Integration (CI) has been claimed to introduce several
  benefits in software development, including high software quality
  and reliability. However, recent work pointed out challenges,
  barriers and bad practices characterizing its adoption. This paper
  empirically investigates what are the bad practices experienced by
  developers applying CI. The investigation has been conducted by
  leveraging semi-structured interviews of 13 experts and mining more
  than 2,300 Stack Overflow posts. As a result, we compiled a catalog
  of 79 CI bad smells belonging to 7 categories related to different
  dimensions of a CI pipeline management and process. We have also
  investigated the perceived importance of the identified bad smells
  through a survey involving 26 professional developers, and discussed
  how the results of our study relate to existing knowledge about CI
  bad practices. Whilst some results, such as the poor usage of
  branches, confirm existing literature, the study also highlights
  uncovered bad practices, e.g., related to static analysis tools or
  the abuse of shell scripts, and contradict knowledge from existing
  literature, e.g., about avoiding nightly builds. We discuss the
  implications of our catalog of CI bad smells for (i) practitioners,
  e.g., favor specific, portable tools over hacking, and do not ignore
  nor hide build failures, (ii) educators, e.g., teach CI culture, not
  just technology, and teach CI by providing examples of what not to
  do, and (iii) researchers, e.g., developing support for failure
  analysis, as well as automated CI bad smell detectors.
