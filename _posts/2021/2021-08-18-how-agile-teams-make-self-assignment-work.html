    a few days ago
    about abstracts that are written as teasers rather than summarizing the paper's results.
    The abstract for <cite>Masood2020a</cite> feels like one of those,
    but once you get into the paper itself
    you realize that a short summary isn't really possible.
    Figure 5 (included at the bottom of this post—click for the full-size image)
    shows just how complicated the forces and feedback loops are,
    and that complexity is why researchers need to use both qualitative and quantitative methods.
    As a reformed engineer my instinct is always to reach for the latter,
    but working with some world-class qualitative researchers
    taught me that close inspection of a few cases
    can be as rigorous as statistics
    and can produce insights that number crunching cannot.
  </p>
  <p>
    The takeaway from this paper for me is the recommendations at the end,
    some of this are listed below.
    As is often the case, these are not surprising,
    but in many cases the opposite conclusion would have been just as plausible;
    what research like this does is tell us which believable alternative is true.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Managers can ensure that the self-assignment decisions do not
      lead to increased specializations or threaten
      cross-functionality, rather assignment choices provide equal
      opportunities to learn (technology, applications, and tools) to
      maintain a balance of knowledge sharing (S4).
    </li>
    <li>
      Managers can guide the team members if they feel they have
      committed to something which is hard to accomplish. However,
      they should avoid discouraging members to pick complex tasks.
      Taking away tasks from the team members is also not recommended
      (S4).
    </li>
    <li>
      Once required information has been conveyed among the team and
      estimates and task breakdown is done, the manager can step out
      from the assignment sessions (S3).
    </li>
    <li>
      If an urgent task comes in during a running sprint, the manager
      can ask for volunteers rather than imposing tasks on someone.
      Knowing the time pressure, it is likely that person with
      relevant skills will pick such a task (S2).
    </li>
    <li>
      If multiple people are interested in working on the same task,
      they can either pair up (S12) or the manager can step in and let
      one of them pick a task (S4), ensuring that the next time the
      other one gets to select their preferred task (S13).
    </li>
    <li>
      Managers can initially let the new team members observe the team
      allocating their tasks and understand the task allocation
      strategies. Other team members can help them choose easier
      tasks (S4) or pair them up with senior members for better
      understanding of the process (S12).
    </li>
    <li>
      The team members miss updating their tasks on their preferred
      project management platform, which can potentially lead to
      issues, e.g., multiple people working on similar
      tasks. Automatic reminders through tools or reminders in daily
      stand-ups can be useful to remind them to update their tasks
      regularly (S6).
    </li>
    <li>
      Individuals can pick tasks in the presence of other team
      members, e.g., at planning or at stand-up. This way other team
      members who have more knowledge about the task can provide
      assistance and transfer relevant knowledge if needed (S13).
    </li>
    <li>
      The manager or team could include some 'stretch tasks' in every
      sprint, i.e., a few extra tasks ready, elaborated and estimated,
      in reserve, so team members can self-assign and complete them if
      they happen to finish all the other tasks early (S5).
    </li>
    <li>
      Teams starting with self-assignment can initially apply for a
      part of their project, e.g., new development features,
      enhancements etc., rather practicing for the entire project
      (S4).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The richness of this paper's results presents me with a problem.
    As <a href="https://third-bit.com/ideas/seeba/">I have repeatedly written elsewhere</a>,
    I think we should supplement or replace the "build a big piece of software in a team" course
    in most undergraduate computer science programs
    with an introduction to the methods and findings of empirical software engineering.
    I know how to teach the quantitative side:
    introduce <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>,
    have students analyze a few small datasets so that they get a feel for basic statistics,
    and then have them recapitulate some of the findings from this site.
  </p>
  <p>
    But how can we teach qualitative methods to this audience?
    I think we should—I don't want to perpetuate today's biases and blindspots—but
    what exercises could we give students?
    Many researchers now make their quantitative data available online,
    but I don't know of any archive of interviews and videos,
    and suspect that it would be difficult to create one without violating ethical and privacy rules.
    Having students analyze questions and responses from discussion forums
    is the best thing I've been able to come up with;
    if someone has a better idea, I'd be grateful if you could reach out.

<blockquote class="abstract">
  Self-assignment, a self-directed method of task allocation in which
  teams and individuals assign and choose work for themselves, is
  considered one of the hallmark practices of empowered,
  self-organizing agile teams. Despite all the benefits it promises,
  agile software teams do not practice it as regularly as other agile
  practices such as iteration planning and daily stand-ups, indicating
  that it is likely not an easy and straighforward practice. There has
  been very little empirical research on self-assignment. This
  Grounded Theory study explores how self-assignment works in agile
  projects. We collected data through interviews with 42 participants
  representing 28 agile teams from 23 software companies and
  supplemented these interviews with observations. Based on rigorous
  application of Grounded Theory analysis procedures such as open,
  axial, and selective coding, we present a comprehensive grounded
  theory of making self-assignment work that explains the (a) context
  and (b) causal conditions that give rise to the need for
  self-assignment, (c) a set of facilitating conditions that mediate
  how self-assignment may be enabled, (d) a set of constraining
  conditions that mediate how self-assignment may be constrained and
  which are overcome by a set of (e) strategies applied by agile
  teams, which in turn result in (f) a set of consequences, all in an
  attempt to make the central phenomenon, self-assignment, work. The
  findings of this study will help agile practitioners and companies
  understand different aspects of self-assignment and practice it with
  confidence regularly as a valuable practice. Additionally, it will
  help teams already practicing self-assignment to apply strategies to
  overcome the challenges they face on an everyday basis.
