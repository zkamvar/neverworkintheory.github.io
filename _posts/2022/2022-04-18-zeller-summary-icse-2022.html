  <p>
    Prof. <a href="https://andreas-zeller.info/">Andreas Zeller</a>
    has posted a short overview of
    <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreasZeller/status/1509477579941687309">current topics in software engineering research</a>
    based on submissions to <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2022">ICSE'22</a>.
    From his thread
    and based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ENiA2w9wHrawZSXYUXxodiNFQvzZeMp_pMhccI68WJE/">this data</a>
    and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1boS95xTimDCcLn2lSeZ_te4zoUn8YNBgNLox-86261w/">this data</a>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Machine learning is clearly a hot topic with 74 accepted papers,
      versus 47 for software testing (the scond most popular topic)
      35 for program analysis,
      and 31 for evolution and maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Only two papers each were accepted on ethics in software engineering,
      software architecture,
      green and sustainable technologies,
      and agile methodsâ€”which is still better than one each on model-driven engineering
      and software visualization.
    </li>
    <li>
      The majority of authors come from China (37.2%) and the United States (30.5%);
      Australia, canada, and the UK together account for as many papers as all of Europe,
      which is perhaps unsurprising for an anglophone conference.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>
      Later:
      Prof. Ian Sommerville (author of a widely-used software engineering textbook)
      wrote <a href="https://iansommerville.com/technology/research-impact/">a short article</a>
      on the underwhelming impact of software engineering research
      that's worth a read.
