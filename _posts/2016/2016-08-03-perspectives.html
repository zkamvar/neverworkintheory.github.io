  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perspectives-Data-Science-Software-Engineering/dp/0128042060"><em>Perspectives
  on Data Science for Software Engineering</em></a> presents the best
  practices of seasoned data miners in software engineering.  Its goal
  is to transfer the knowledge of experts from seasoned software
  engineers and data scientists to newcomers in the field.  While
  there are many books covering data mining and software engineering
  basics, they present only the fundamentals and lack the perspective
  that comes from real-world experience.  This book offers unique
  insights into the wisdom of the community's leaders.  Ideas are
  presented in digestible chapters designed to be applicable across
  many domains.  Topics included cover data collection, data sharing,
  data mining, and how to utilize these techniques in successful
  software projects.  Newcomers to software engineering data science
  will learn the tips and tricks of the trade, while more experienced
  data scientists will benefit from war stories that show what traps
  to avoid.
